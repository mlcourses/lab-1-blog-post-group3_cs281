# Lab 01: Doing stuff with hardware!

Please write a blog post describing your lab here.

This is just an example of how you might structure your blog post, feel free to edit as you wish. For example, you might divide the lab into different sections each with their own intro, instructions, results, and takeaways. Please see the rubric for details on how the post will be evaluated.

## Overview and Motivation
In this lab, we will explore the environment that we will use for the hardware lab sequence of the course. We will learn about the PB-503 breadboard prototyping stations and about the Arduino, a microcontroller system for supporting embedded processor control. We will start by exploring the features of the breadboard and then will integrate the use of the Arduino with the breadboard. asaaaasyshflksdhdfjklsfdhg
