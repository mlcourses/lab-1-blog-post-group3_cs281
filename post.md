# Lab 01 : Doing stuff with hardware - A Beginner's Guide to Building and Controlling Digital Circuits

## Overview and Motivation

In this lab, we will explore the environment that we will use for the hardware lab sequence of the course. We will learn about the PB-503 breadboard prototyping stations and about the Arduino, a microcontroller system for supporting embedded processor control. We will start by exploring the features of the breadboard and then will integrate the use of the Arduino with the breadboard. By the end, you'll have hands-on experience with a breadboard, LEDs, and the Arduino, learning how these elements can be combined to create simple but powerful systems.
