# Lab 01 : Doing stuff with hardware - A Beginner's Guide to Building and Controlling Digital Circuits

## Overview and Motivation

In this lab, we will explore the environment that we will use for the hardware lab sequence of the course. We will learn about the PB-503 breadboard prototyping stations and about the Arduino, a microcontroller system for supporting embedded processor control. We will start by exploring the features of the breadboard and then will integrate the use of the Arduino with the breadboard. By the end, you'll have hands-on experience with a breadboard, LEDs, and the Arduino, learning how these elements can be combined to create simple but powerful systems.

## Project Steps

## Breadboard Basics

- **Materials Needed**: Start with a PB-503 breadboard prototyping station and an Arduino kit. Handle these devices with care to avoid damage.
- **Understanding the PB-503**: This integrated device includes switches, LEDs, power supplies, and a function generator, all centered around a breadboard. For simplicity, we'll refer to the PB-503 as the breadboard throughout our class.
- **Power Supply**: The PB-503 is equipped with a +5 Volt power supply located in the upper right corner. This is the only power supply we'll use, as our circuits are designed for 5 volts. Remember, never connect to any voltage other than +5 Volts to avoid damaging your circuits.
  - **Terms for +5v**: high, hot, on, 1, Vcc.
  - **Terms for Ground**: 0 (volts), low, off, 0 (logic 0), GND.
  - In Boolean algebra, +5 is TRUE, and Ground is FALSE.

### Exploring the Breadboard

1. **Initial Observation**: Notice the wires from the top rows leading to some of the breadboard's columns, connecting certain holes to +5V or Ground. Your task is to understand the wiring pattern beneath the surface.
2. **Logic Indicators**: Use the onboard Logic Indicators (eight on the right-hand side) to test for HIGH or LOW voltage across the board. Connecting a wire from a point on the breadboard to a Logic Indicator will show red for +5V (HIGH) and green for Ground (LOW).
3. **Experimentation**: Start probing different locations on the breadboard to determine their voltage status. Record which pins are connected to +5V, Ground, or are floating (unconnected).
4. **Conducting Experiments**: Continue exploring where +5V and Ground are distributed on the board. Document your findings and generalize which holes are neither HIGH nor LOW. Investigate how holes on either side of the central groove are connected.

### Building Your First Digital Circuit

- **Safety First**: Always turn off the breadboard's power before constructing or modifying circuits to prevent damage. Double-check your wiring against the circuit diagram before powering on.
- **Documentation**: Record your experiments, observations, and any conclusions you draw from testing different parts of the breadboard.
